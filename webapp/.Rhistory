numbers <- seq(70, 79)
numbers
## Using the built in length function, create a variable `len` that
## is equal to the length of your vector
## `numbers`
len <- length(numbers)
len
## Using the `mean` function, create a variable `numbers_mean` that
## is the mean of your vector `numbers`
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)
numbers_mean
## Create a vector `lower_numbers` that is the numbers 60:69
lower_numbers <- seq(60, 69)
lower_numbers
## Create a vector `all_numbers` that combines your `lower_numbers` and `numbers` vectors
## Ensure the result looks right!
all_numbers <- c(lower_numbers, numbers)
all_numbers
## Which numbers (out of all_numbers) are larger than 70?
## Use logical operations to create a logical
## vector (TRUES/FALSES) that tell which number is larger
index <- all_numbers >= 70
all_numbers[index]
index
## Out of your all numbers, extract only those that are
## smaller than 70

## Hint: check out the modulo operator '%%'
for (i in 1:20) {
x <- 2

}
## Print even numbers only in your vector.
## Do _not_ create the subvector manually, use modulo operator and logical

### ------------------ Challenge ------------------
## Write a function `remove_digits` that will remove all digits
## (i.e. characters '0' through '9')
## from all elements in a
## *vector of strings*.
## For instance, "a2b" -> "ab"
remove_digits <- function(a){
for(i in 1:length(a)){
a[i] <- gsub("[0-9]+", "", a[i])
}
for(i in 1:length(a)){
print(a[i])
}
}
## Demonstrate that your approach is successful by passing a
## vector of courses to your function
## For example,
## RemoveDigits(c("INFO 201", "CSE 142", "mps-803c", "K2-team '21"))
## should return
## c("INFO "    "CSE "     "mps-c"    "K-team '")
remove_digits(c("INFO 201", "CSE 142", "mps-803c", "K2-team '21"))
## Write an if/else statement that checks to see if your vector has any digits.
## If it does have
## digits, print "Oh no!", if it does not then print "Yay!"
## Hint: check out the functions 'any' and 'all'
final <- "info 201"
if(grepl("[[:digit:]]", final)){
print("Oh no!")
}else{
print("Yay!")
}

## ---------- A2: Basic R (variables, vectors, functions) ----------
## -------------------- Set up --------------------
## In this assignment we ask you to use `stringr` package for
## the string functions.
## Read more about it in Wickham & Grolemund "R for Data Science"
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html
## Install the library if needed and load it
## Ensure you don't install the library more than once!
install.packages("stringr")
library("stringr")
## -------------------- Defining variables --------------------
## Here we ask you to define, compute, and print a number of variables
## ---------- Example: ----------
## Create variable `my_name` that is equal to your first name
my_name <- "Mira"
##cat("I am", my_name, "\n")
## ---------- end of the example ----------
## Create a numeric variable `my_age` that is equal to your age
my_age <- 18
my_age
## How many seconds is there in a year?  Compute this number!
## Assign it to a suitably named variable and print the result
## with a informative message
seconds_in_year <- 31536000
cat("There are", seconds_in_year, "in a year.")
## What is your age in seconds?  Use the variable 'my_age' you computed
## above and seconds-in-year, and compute it.  Assign the result to a
## suitable named variable
my_age_in_seconds <- my_age * seconds_in_year
my_age_in_seconds
## Are you more than 650M seconds old?  Perform such logical operation and
## assign the result to a variable 'I_am_old'.  Print the result with a
## suitable message
I_am_old <- my_age_in_seconds > 650000000
cat("Am I old?", "\n", I_am_old)
### How many seconds is a typical human lifetime?
lifetime <- seconds_in_year * 72
lifetime
### -------------------- Working with functions --------------------
## Write a function called `make_introduction` that takes in two
## arguments: name, and age.
## This function should return a string value that says something like
## "Hello, my name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old".
## NB!  It should _return_ the string, not print it!
make_introduction <- function(name, age){
intro <- paste("Hello, my name is", name, "and I'm", age, "years old.")
return(intro)
}
## Create a variable `my_intro` by passing your variables `my_name` and `my_age`
## into your `make_introduction`
## function.  Always print the result!
my_intro <- make_introduction(my_name, my_age)
my_intro
## Create a variable `casual_intro` by substituting "Hello, my name is ",
## with "Hey, I'm" in your `my_intro`
## variable.  Check out stringr functions
## 'str_replace' and 'str_replace_all'
casual_intro <- "Hey, I'm"
str_replace(my_intro, "Hello, my name is", casual_intro)
## Create a new variable `loud_intro`, which is your `my_intro` variable
## in all upper-case letters
loud_intro <- toupper(my_intro)
loud_intro
## Using the `str_count` function, create a variable `occurrences` that
## stores the # of times the letter "e"
## appears in `my_intro`
str_count(my_intro, "e")
## Write another function `double` that takes in a (numeric) variable
## and returns that variable multiplied by two
double <- function(number){
return(number*2)
}
## Using your `double` function, create a variable `seconds_in_two_years`,
## which is the number of seconds in two years.
## Always print your results!
seconds_in_two_years <- double(seconds_in_year)
seconds_in_two_years
## Write another function `cube` that takes in a value and returns that value
## cubed
cubed <- function(number){
return(number*number*number)
}
## Create a (suitably named) variable by passing the number 3 to your `cube`
## function
threexthree <- cubed(3)
threexthree
## Use for-loop to print cubes of numbers 1..10
## Hint: see course book
# https://faculty.washington.edu/otoomet/info201-book/functions.html#for-loops
for(i in 1:10){
i3 <- cubed(i)
cat(i, "^3 = ", i3, "\n", sep = "")
}
### ------------------------------ working with vectors ------------------------------
## Create a vector `movies` that contains the names of six movies you like
## Always print your results!
movies <- c("Ten things I hate about you", "Zindagi Nah Meilgi Dobara", "Yeh Jawaani hai Dewaani", "Hunger Games", "Pride and Prejudice", "Kapoor and Sons")
movies
## Create a vector `top_three` that only contains the first three movies in the vector.
## Use indexing.
top_three <- c(movies[2], movies[3], movies[6])
top_three
## Using your vector and the paste method, create a vector `excited` that adds the phrase -
## " is a great movie!" to the end of each element in your movies vector
excited <- str_c(movies, " is a great movie!")
excited
## Create a vector `without_four` that has your first three movies, and your 5th and 6th movies.
without_four <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
movies[without_four]
## Create a vector `numbers` that is the numbers 70 through 79
numbers <- seq(70, 79)
numbers
## Using the built in length function, create a variable `len` that
## is equal to the length of your vector
## `numbers`
len <- length(numbers)
len
## Using the `mean` function, create a variable `numbers_mean` that
## is the mean of your vector `numbers`
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)
numbers_mean
## Create a vector `lower_numbers` that is the numbers 60:69
lower_numbers <- seq(60, 69)
lower_numbers
## Create a vector `all_numbers` that combines your `lower_numbers` and `numbers` vectors
## Ensure the result looks right!
all_numbers <- c(lower_numbers, numbers)
all_numbers
## Which numbers (out of all_numbers) are larger than 70?
## Use logical operations to create a logical
## vector (TRUES/FALSES) that tell which number is larger

all_numbers[index]
index
## Out of your all numbers, extract only those that are
## smaller than 70
small_index <- all_numbers < 70
all_numbers[small_index]
## Compute squares of all those numbers that are smaller
## than 70 in your vector
squares <- c(lower_numbers * lower_numbers)
squares
## Compute modulo by 2 of all your numbers.
## Hint: check out the modulo operator '%%'
for (i in 1:20) {
x <- 2
modulo_numbers <- all_numbers[i]%%x

### This lab will prepare you for PS4!
### This is a _graded lab_, you'll get 3
### points if you solve and submit it correctly
### Squrrel census data is downloaded from NY Open Data Portal
### See the readme
### https://bitbucket.org/otoomet/data/src/master/nature/
### for more information and better layout of the
### variable names
###
### Variables:
###
### **X**: Longitude coordinate for squirrel sighting point
### **Y**: Latitude coordinate for squirrel sighting point
### **Unique Squirrel ID**: Identification tag for each squirrel
### sightings. The tag is comprised of "Hectare ID" + "Shift" + "Date" +
### "Hectare Squirrel Number."
### **Hectare**: ID tag, which is derived from the hectare grid used to
### divide and count the park area. One axis that runs predominantly
### north-to-south is numerical (1-42), and the axis that runs
### predominantly east-to-west is roman characters (A-I).
### **Shift**: Value is either "AM" or "PM," to communicate whether or
### not the sighting session occurred in the morning or late afternoon.
### **Date**: Concatenation of the sighting session day and month.
### **Hectare Squirrel Number**: Number within the chronological
### sequence of squirrel sightings for a discrete sighting session.
### **Age**: Value is either "Adult" or "Juvenile."
### **Primary Fur Color**: Value is either "Gray," "Cinnamon" or
### "Black."
### **Highlight Fur Color**: Discrete value or string values comprised
### of "Gray," "Cinnamon" or "Black."
### **Combination of Primary and Highlight Color**: A combination of the
### previous two columns; this column gives the total permutations of
### primary and highlight colors observed.
### **Color notes**: Sighters occasionally added commentary on the
### squirrel fur conditions. These notes are provided here.
### **Location**: Value is either "Ground Plane" or "Above Ground."
### Sighters were instructed to indicate the location of where the
### squirrel was when first sighted.
### **Above Ground Sighter Measurement**: For squirrel sightings on the
### ground plane, fields were populated with a value of “FALSE.”
### **Specific Location**: Sighters occasionally added commentary on the
### squirrel location. These notes are provided here.
### **Running**: Squirrel was seen running.
### **Chasing**: Squirrel was seen chasing another squirrel.
### **Climbing**: Squirrel was seen climbing a tree or other
### environmental landmark.
### **Eating**: Squirrel was seen eating.
### **Foraging**: Squirrel was seen foraging for food.
### **Other Activities**:
### **Kuks**: Squirrel was heard kukking, a chirpy vocal communication
### used for a variety of reasons.
### **Quaas**: Squirrel was heard quaaing, an elongated vocal
### communication which can indicate the presence of a ground predator
### such as a dog.
### **Moans**: Squirrel was heard moaning, a high-pitched vocal
### communication which can indicate the presence of an air predator
### such as a hawk.
### **Tail flags**: Squirrel was seen flagging its tail. Flagging is a
### whipping motion used to exaggerate squirrel's size and confuse
### rivals or predators. Looks as if the squirrel is scribbling with
### tail into the air.
### **Tail twitches**: Squirrel was seen twitching its tail. Looks like
### a wave running through the tail, like a breakdancer doing the arm
### wave. Often used to communicate interest, curiosity.
### **Approaches**: Squirrel was seen approaching human, seeking food.
### **Indifferent**: Squirrel was indifferent to human presence.
### **Runs from**: Squirrel was seen running from humans, seeing them as
### a threat.
### **Other Interactions**: Sighter notes on other types of interactions
### between squirrels and humans.
### **Lat/Long**: Latitude and longitude
